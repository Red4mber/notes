## Hello you

I use github as a kind of backup/publish for my obsidian notes. So here's all my notes, ever
 

- [Hell's Gate - Walking the PEB](/Hell's Gate - Walking the PEB.md)
- [Direct Syscalls](/Direct Syscalls.md)
I wrote these two kinda like a blog post, so i guess they would be nice to read ? 

The rest is mostly notes i took for myself while studying so i took them with less care, but feel free to look around o//
