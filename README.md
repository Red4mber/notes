# Notes

Hello you

I use github as a kind of backup/publish for my obsidian notes. So here's all my notes, ever
 

I wrote these two kinda like a blog post, so i guess they would be nice to read ?
- [Hell's Gate - Walking the PEB](https://github.com/Red4mber/notes/blob/main/Hell's%20Gate%20-%20Walking%20the%20PEB.md)
- [Direct Syscalls](https://github.com/Red4mber/notes/blob/main/Direct%20Syscalls.md)



The rest is mostly notes i took for myself while studying so i took them with less care, but feel free to look around o//
